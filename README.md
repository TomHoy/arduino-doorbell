# arduino-doorbell

Original program based off of https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs/

This new program adds some code cleanup, multiple songs in a file, and some other neat things! (and button detection, of course!)

# Usage
The code is mostly fully documented, and explanation is within the files.

# Compilation instructions
This project is intended for use on the NodeMCU 1.0 boards, and may not work on other boards.
Simply import the project into your IDE of choice, and compile for the board and you're set.

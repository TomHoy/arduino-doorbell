# arduino-doorbell

Original program based off of https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs/

This new program adds some code cleanup, multiple songs in a file, and some other neat things! (and button detection, of course!)

# Usage
The code is mostly fully documented, and explanation is within the files.
